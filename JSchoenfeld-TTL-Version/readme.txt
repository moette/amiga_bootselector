This bootselector is based on the idea of Jens Schönfeld (www.c64.de) to create a bootselector by only using TTL chips.
Jens licensed the schemantics under the GPL version 2. See LICENSE file!

Oliver Eschenbach created a first Eagle layout based upon that schemanctics and handed them over to me (Marko Oette).

I took over to add several other functions to the boot selector. Eg. make it useable on the A2000 / A3000.
